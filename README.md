# Connect Four App
This repository contains code for a Connect Four clone that my friend and I worked on. This code was written for our Software Design class and it is written using Java.

## About The Project:
The purpose of this project was to create our own version of Connect Four so that we could familiarize ourselves with the JavaFX library. The project contains a game board, customization options, a how-to page, and the option to undo moves.

## How to use:
- Unzip the folder, and run the project using Eclipse or IntelliJ
- Click the button on the welcome page to start playing the game
- With another player, take turns placing a piece on the board. To undo a move, click on the Gameplay tab and select the "Reverse Move" option
- To change the theme of the board, click on the Themes tab and select any of the three options.
- The Options tab lets the user start a new game, exit the program, or view instructions on how to play the game.
