# ConnectFourApp
# Description
This is the first collaborative UI project I did for my UI-Design class. The code and UI was developed using Java and JavaFX. This App is a remake of the classic game Connect Four. The Instructions for how to use the app can be found within the Application itself. There is also an option to update the Theme of the App. You can chose between the Default Theme, a Naruto theme, and an Adventure Time Theme.
